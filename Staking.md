## Connecting Metamask

To be able to view the node one has to first install Metamask and connect it to the right network (e.g. Mainnet, Testnet). After Metamask is enabled a "Connect Metamask" button should appear on the single node view which has to be clicked in order to start staking.

## Staking Reward

The staking reward is 20% of all the fees earned by an Oracle Node divided by the total tokens of all stakers. This means that the more staker are currently staking on a node the less fees every additional stakers is able to earn.

## Staking Period

A staking period is 10000 blocks which is roughly 16 days. After this period each staker is able to claim its share.

When starting to stake one is placed into the next period. Meaning that until the next period starts one is not earning a staking reward. In addition to this the reward for a period can only be paid out after it has ended. Therefore, it might take two whole period (1 month) for the first reward to be paid out.

?> **Tip** It is not neccessary to claim the reward every period as the staking reward can also be claimed in bulk for multiple periods at once.
