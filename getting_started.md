# Getting Started

The Acira Network consists of three different groups of actors. First, the developers which utilize the Acria Network to gain off-chain information. Second, the Oracle Node Operators which provide their data to the Acria Network. And third, the stakers which grant an oracle node trust and reputation.

## Developers

Developers are utilizing the Acria Network for their product. Their users are paying fees to access the information available on the various Oracle Nodes. 

Current the Acria Network can be used on the following chains:
- Polkadot
- Ethereum
- Binance Smart Chain

Please follow the developer guide to learn how to implement the Acria Network.

## Oracle Node Operators

Oracle Node Operators are owners of an API which they also provide via the Acia Network. Via the Acria-Oracle-Node Client it is possible to serve a single api to all compatible chains simultaniously.

Please follow the Oracle Node Operator guide to learn how to become an Oracle Node Operator.

## Stakers

?> **Tip** The more stakers are active on a single Oracle Node the lower the staking reward becomes.

The Stakers are able to earn up to 20% of the fees earned by a Node. They naturally select the most profitable nodes which also supply the right information on time as otherwise due to the slashing machanic it would significantly reduce their staking reward.

The more staker are on a Node the more trustworthy it becomes. This means that an Oracle Node operator tries to get as many Stakers on his node as possible.
